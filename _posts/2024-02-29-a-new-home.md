I've been writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@siddharth.shankar) for a few years, and then - for a relatively shorter time - on [Substack](https://substack.com/@sidshankar). It never felt right. It never felt like **home**. I felt like I was writing for an audience, and that "they" expected me to stick to certain topics. These were almost certainly self-inflicted pressures, but as long as I stayed on those mediums (ha ha) I would never be truly comfortable. 

Writing used to be fun. I want it to be fun again, and I want to write about _whatever the heck I want_, so here we are. In a space that's _truly_ mine. Where I'm writing only for me. 

Until the next post ðŸ‘‹
